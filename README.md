## All Information in One Place
A frustration when recieving incoming support calls is to remember all the information given in a short amount of time. You either have to fill in information in a complex support system, jot down the information on a piece of paper or use some clunky app. With **QuickSupport** I have designing an app tailored to manage support requests, streamline communication and enhance the user experience. Its user-friendly interface makes it easier to submit issues in whatever support system that may be in use.
### Features:
- Graphical user interface that is easy to understand
- Buttons for easy navigation when filling in information
- Template for filling in infomation with the click of a button
- Search the entire document
- Saves file in txt format so it can be opened in any text editor
- Autosave every three minutes
